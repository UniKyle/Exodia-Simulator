# Exodia-Simulator

Plays an Exodia deck optimally in order to determine an average win percentage for the deck.

Random ideas:
- win% for going first/second
- what cards are the best to get in your opening hand?
- what's the best order to play your cards in?
- possibly get a win% for every opening hand?
- test change
